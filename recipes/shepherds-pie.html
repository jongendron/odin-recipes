    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><strong>Shepherdâ€™s pie</strong> is a dish of British Isles origin that makes use of vegetables and chopped meat cooked in a casserole topped with or surrounded by mashed potatoes.</p>

    <p>To cook this dish, start by preheating the oven to 400 degrees Farenheit and brining 6 cups of water to a boil. While the water is boiling, peel and wash  ~1 lb of potatoes. Once the water starts to bubble, boil the potatoes for about ~10 min, or until tender.</p>
    
    <p>While the potatoes are boiling, pan fry 1 lb of ground meat (beef or lamb) until fully browned; be sure to add any spices for flavor (i.e. rosemary, thyme, etc) during this step.</p> 
    
    <p>Once the meat is cooked, pan fry an assortment of vegetable to use as the casserole filler until they are tender enough to eat. Typical vegetables include: peas, carrots, onions, and corn. Optionally, you can cook the vegetables with a 1/2 cup of worcestershire sauce and 2 tbsp of tomatoe paste for added flavor.</p>

    <p> By the time the vegetables are complete, the potatoes should be tender enough to mash. Mash the potatoes with 1/2 stick of butter and ~1 cup of milk. Once this is done, the casserole can be assembled.</p>

    <p>To assemble the casserole, start by evenly combining the pan fried vegetable and the ground meat and placing them into an over safe baking dish. Then add then evenly spead the mash potatoes over the casserole base and bake for 20-40 minutes.</p>
