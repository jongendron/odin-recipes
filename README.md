# odin-recipes
This website presents a select few recipes that are most appealing to me @jongendron. This marks the first full website I have made on my own whilst following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This website demonstrates my ability to construct basic html files, including my knowledge of:

> 1. Elementary tags and elements
> 2. Content and images
> 3. Website navigation (links b/w pages).
